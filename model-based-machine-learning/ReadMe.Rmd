# Model-Based Machine Learning and Probabilistic Programming Using RStan

## Introduction
I recently started working on my Ph.D dissertation which utilizes a vast amount of different spatial data types. During the process, I discovered that there were alot of concepts about using R for spatial data analysis that I was not aware of. The purpose of this report is to document some of those concepts and my favorite packages for spatial data analysis. This report is orgainized as follows: Firstly we need to ask why R is a good tool of choice for spatial analysis; secondly we shall go through a typical data analysis life-cycle from getting spatial data to data preparation, exploration, visualization and geostatistical analysis.

### Why use R for Spatial Data Analysis
You might be asking yourself; why use R for spatial analysis when there are commercial and open source Geographical Information Systems (GIS) like ESRI ArcMap and QGIS respectively. These are some of my reasons:

* R is free and open source
* Reproducibility: Researchers can reproduce their own analyses or other people's analyses and verify their findings
* Packages: There are a vast number of R packages for spatial data analysis, statistical modeling, visualisation, machine learning and more.

#### R Packages for Spatial Data Analysis
Some of my favorite packages for spatial data analysis include:


## Conclusion
In the next blog post, we shall see how to perform geostatistical analysis on spatial data.
